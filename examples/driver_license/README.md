# Driver License Scanner Examples

A comprehensive collection of driver license scanning solutions using Dynamsoft APIs, ranging from foundational implementations to production-ready components.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+ (for ready-to-use component)
- Modern web browser
- [Dynamsoft License Key](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense/?product=dcv&package=cross-platform)

## 📁 Project Structure

This project demonstrates two different approaches to building driver license scanners:

```
driver_license/
├── foundational/           # Low-level API implementation
│   ├── index.html         # Single-file scanner with PDF417 barcode reading
│   ├── style.css          # Modern responsive styling
│   └── README.md          # Foundational example documentation
└── ready_to_use/          # High-level component implementation
    ├── src/               # TypeScript source code
    ├── samples/           # Example implementations
    ├── dist/              # Built JavaScript bundles
    └── README.md          # Ready-to-use component documentation
```

## 🎯 Examples Overview

### 1. Foundational Example
**Path:** `foundational/`
**Complexity:** ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (Intermediate - Manual Implementation)

A lightweight, single-file implementation that demonstrates:
- PDF417 barcode scanning from driver licenses
- Camera and image upload modes
- Basic barcode data extraction
- Responsive web design

**Perfect for:**
- Learning the basics of barcode scanning
- Understanding manual implementation details
- Custom integration requirements
- Developers who want full control over the scanning process

### 2. Ready-to-Use Component
**Path:** `ready_to_use/`
**Complexity:** ⭐☆☆☆☆ (Beginner - Drop-in Component)

A comprehensive pre-built component that provides:
- Full front/back image capture workflow
- Automatic document detection and correction
- PDF417 barcode reading with data extraction
- Professional license input UI
- Structured data parsing and validation
- Production-ready error handling

**Perfect for:**
- Production applications
- Quick deployment and integration
- Developers who want a complete solution
- Professional UI without custom development

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Foundational Example (5 minutes)
1. Navigate to `foundational/`
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Allow camera permissions
4. Scan a driver license barcode

### Option 2: Ready-to-Use Component (5 minutes)
1. Navigate to `ready_to_use/samples/`
2. Open `hello-world.html` in a web browser
3. Enter your Dynamsoft license key or use trial
4. Click "Start Driver License Scanner"
5. Follow the guided scanning workflow

## 📖 Learning Path

We recommend following this progression:

1. **Start with Foundational** (`foundational/`)
   - Understand basic barcode scanning concepts
   - Learn PDF417 data extraction
   - Experiment with camera integration

2. **Move to Ready-to-Use** (`ready_to_use/`)
   - Experience professional UI and workflow
   - See complete production-ready implementation
   - Use for actual projects and deployment

## 🔧 Technologies Used

### Foundational Example
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Dynamsoft Barcode Reader SDK
- Modern CSS with responsive design
- HTML5 Camera API

### Ready-to-Use Component
- TypeScript
- Dynamsoft Driver License Scanner SDK
- Advanced image processing
- Modular component architecture
- Professional UI components
